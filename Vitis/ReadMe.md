# Vitis Examples

## Getting Started Tutorial with Vitis

### [Xilinx University Program Vitis Tutorial](https://xilinx.github.io/xup_compute_acceleration/)

> **Hands-on Labs**
- [ ] **1.Introduction to Vitis:** How to use the `Vitis GUI` to create a new project using a simple vector addition example, including `Emulation_SW` and `Emulation_HW`.
- [ ] **2.Improving Performance:** How bandwidth can be improved, and thus system performance, by using wider data path and transferring data in parallel using multiple memory banks.
- [ ] **3.Optimization:** Analyze various generated reports and then apply optimization techniques, such as `DATAFLOW` on the host program and `PIPELINING` on kernel side to improve throughput and data transfer rate.
- [ ] **4.Vision Lab:** Create a Vitis design using the `command line`. The design uses two kernels from the Vitis Accelerated Libraries, image resize and image resize & blur. You will run software emulation and test the kernels in hardware.
- [ ] **5.PYNQ Labs:** Learn how to use PYNQ for easier user of Xilinx compute acceleration platforms.
